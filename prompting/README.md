# Prompting Techniques for Claude Code

This directory contains prompting techniques and best practices for effective AI-assisted development.

## Contents

*   [prompt-engineering.md](prompt-engineering.md): Comprehensive guide to crafting effective prompts for code generation, debugging, and complex tasks.

## Key Principles

1. **Be Specific**: Clear inputs produce clear outputs
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant code, constraints, and examples
3. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Modular prompts work better than monolithic ones
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
5. **Use Examples**: Few-shot prompting improves consistency

## Prompt Categories

### Code Generation
- Specify language, framework, and constraints
- Include input/output expectations
- Mention coding standards to follow

### Debugging
- Provide error messages and stack traces
- Include relevant code snippets
- Describe expected vs actual behavior

### Refactoring
- Identify specific goals (performance, readability, security)
- List constraints to maintain
- Specify patterns to avoid

### Documentation
- Define target audience
- Specify format requirements
- Include key points to cover
